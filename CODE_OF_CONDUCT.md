## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in {{PROJECT_NAME}} a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, colour, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

We recognise that a thriving open source community requires **psychological safety** — an environment where people can contribute, ask questions, make mistakes, and learn without fear of ridicule or retaliation.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behaviour

The following behaviours contribute to a positive environment:

**Communication**
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Assuming good intent while addressing impact
- Communicating clearly and patiently, especially with newcomers

**Collaboration**
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy and kindness toward other community members
- Being collaborative rather than competitive
- Mentoring and supporting less experienced contributors
- Celebrating others' contributions and successes

**Professionalism**
- Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes
- Learning from the experience and avoiding repetition
- Respecting others' time and attention
- Staying on topic in project spaces
- Following project guidelines and conventions

**Accessibility**
- Using plain language and avoiding unnecessary jargon
- Providing alt text for images and transcripts for audio/video
- Being patient with those using assistive technologies
- Accommodating different communication styles and needs
- Recognising that not everyone communicates the same way

### Unacceptable Behaviour

The following behaviours are considered harassment and are unacceptable:

**Harassment**
- The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following (online or in-person)
- Unwelcome physical contact or simulated physical contact (e.g., emoji)
- Sustained disruption of talks, events, or online discussions

**Discrimination**
- Discriminatory jokes and language
- Posting or threatening to post others' personally identifying information ("doxing")
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour
- Microaggressions — subtle, often unintentional, discriminatory comments or actions

**Professional Misconduct**
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Misrepresenting affiliation or contributions
- Plagiarism or claiming credit for others' work
- Retaliating against anyone who reports a Code of Conduct violation
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Grey Areas

Some situations require judgement. When uncertain:

- **Intent vs Impact**: Good intentions do not excuse harmful impact. Focus on making things right.
- **Power Dynamics**: Those with more power (maintainers, employers, experienced contributors) must be especially mindful of their impact.
- **Cultural Differences**: What's acceptable varies by culture. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and ask.
- **Humour**: Jokes at others' expense are rarely funny to everyone. Punch up, not down.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

**Online Spaces**
- Repository discussions, issues, and pull/merge requests
- Project chat channels (Matrix, Discord, Slack, IRC)
- Mailing lists and forums
- Social media when representing the project
- Video calls and virtual meetings

**In-Person Spaces**
- Conferences, meetups, and events
- Workshops and training sessions
- Any gathering where you represent the project

**Representation**
This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples include:

## Enforcement Guidelines

The {{CONDUCT_TEAM}} will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

### 1. Correction

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**Duration**: 1-4 weeks

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period.

Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**Duration**: 1-6 months

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
