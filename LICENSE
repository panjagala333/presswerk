PALIMPSEST-MPL LICENSE VERSION 1.0
================================================================================

File-level copyleft with ethical use and quantum-safe provenance

Based on Mozilla Public License 2.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREAMBLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This License extends the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0) with provisions
for ethical use, post-quantum cryptographic provenance, and emotional lineage
protection. The base MPL-2.0 terms apply except where explicitly modified by
the Exhibits below.

Like a palimpsest manuscript where each layer builds upon what came before,
this license recognizes that creative works carry history, context, and meaning
that transcend mere code or text.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1: BASE LICENSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This License incorporates the full text of Mozilla Public License 2.0 by
reference. The complete MPL-2.0 text is available at:
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/

All terms, conditions, and definitions from MPL-2.0 apply except where
explicitly modified by the Exhibits in this License.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2: ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1. "Emotional Lineage"
    means the narrative, cultural, symbolic, and contextual meaning embedded
    in Covered Software, including but not limited to: protest traditions,
    cultural heritage, trauma narratives, and community stories.

2.2. "Provenance Metadata"
    means cryptographically signed attribution information attached to or
    associated with Covered Software, including author identities, timestamps,
    modification history, and lineage references.

2.3. "Non-Interpretive System"
    means any automated system that processes Covered Software without
    preserving or considering its Emotional Lineage, including but not
    limited to: AI training pipelines, content aggregators, and automated
    summarization tools.

2.4. "Quantum-Safe Signature"
    means a cryptographic signature using algorithms resistant to attacks
    by quantum computers, as specified in Exhibit B.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3: ETHICAL USE REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the rights and obligations under MPL-2.0:

3.1. Emotional Lineage Preservation
    You must make reasonable efforts to preserve and communicate the
    Emotional Lineage of Covered Software when distributing or creating
    derivative works. This includes maintaining narrative context, cultural
    attributions, and symbolic meaning where documented.

3.2. Non-Interpretive System Notice
    If You use Covered Software as input to a Non-Interpretive System, You
    must:
    (a) document such use in a publicly accessible manner; and
    (b) not claim that outputs of such systems carry the Emotional Lineage
        of the original work without explicit permission from Contributors.

3.3. Ethical Use Declaration
    Commercial use of Covered Software requires acknowledgment that You have
    read and understood Exhibit A (Ethical Use Guidelines) and agree to act
    in good faith accordance with its principles.

See Exhibit A for complete Ethical Use Guidelines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4: PROVENANCE REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1. Metadata Preservation
    You must not strip, alter, or obscure Provenance Metadata from Covered
    Software except where technically necessary and with clear documentation
    of any changes.

4.2. Quantum-Safe Provenance (Optional)
    Contributors may sign their Contributions using Quantum-Safe Signatures.
    If Quantum-Safe Signatures are present, You must preserve them in all
    distributions.

4.3. Lineage Chain
    When creating derivative works, You should extend the provenance chain
    to include Your own contributions, maintaining cryptographic linkage to
    prior Contributors where feasible.

See Exhibit B for Quantum-Safe Provenance specifications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5: GOVERNANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.1. Stewardship Council
    This License is maintained by the Palimpsest Stewardship Council, which
    may issue clarifications, interpretive guidance, and future versions.

5.2. Version Selection
    You may use Covered Software under this version of the License or any
    later version published by the Palimpsest Stewardship Council.

5.3. Dispute Resolution
    Disputes regarding interpretation of Ethical Use Requirements (Section 3)
    should first be submitted to the Palimpsest Stewardship Council for
    non-binding guidance before pursuing legal remedies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6: COMPATIBILITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1. MPL-2.0 Compatibility
    Covered Software under this License may be combined with software under
    MPL-2.0. The combined work must comply with both licenses.

6.2. Secondary Licenses
    The Secondary License provisions of MPL-2.0 Section 3.3 apply to this
    License.
