## Repository Focus
- `rsr-template-repo` is treated as a Rhodium Standard Repository; obey the Rhodium policies, maintain `.bot_directives`, and keep `.machines_readable/6scm/` authoritative.
- Prefer to keep generated files out of source control, and regenerate them with the documented commands before committing.

## Workflow
1. Inspect `.machines_readable/6scm/STATE.scm` for blockers and next actions.
2. Respect any constraints listed inside `.machines_readable/6scm/AGENTIC.scm` when tooling changes are requested.
3. After finishing edits, update STATE with your outcomes and commit with a concise, imperative message.

## Delivery Promises
- Mention in summaries whether STATE, `contractiles/`, or `.bot_directives/` changed.
- Keep this file in sync with the repository’s status; update it if the governance changes.
