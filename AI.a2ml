## Repository Focus
- **presswerk** (Print Doctor engine) is a Rhodium Standard Repository; obey the Rhodium policies, maintain `.bot_directives/`, and keep `.machine_readable/` authoritative.
- Prefer to keep generated files out of source control, and regenerate them with the documented commands before committing.

## Canonical Locations
- Machine-readable metadata: `.machine_readable/` ONLY (STATE.scm, META.scm, ECOSYSTEM.scm, AGENTIC.scm, NEUROSYM.scm, PLAYBOOK.scm)
- Bot directives: `.bot_directives/`
- Source code: `crates/`
- ABI proofs: `src/abi/`
- FFI implementation: `ffi/zig/`

## Workflow
1. Read `0-AI-MANIFEST.a2ml` FIRST (universal entry point for all agents).
2. Inspect `.machine_readable/STATE.scm` for blockers and next actions.
3. Respect any constraints listed inside `.machine_readable/AGENTIC.scm` when tooling changes are requested.
4. After finishing edits, update STATE with your outcomes and commit with a concise, imperative message.

## Delivery Promises
- Mention in summaries whether STATE, `contractiles/`, or `.bot_directives/` changed.
- Keep this file in sync with the repository's status; update it if the governance changes.
