= Contractiles Template Set
:toc:
:sectnums:

This directory contains the generalized contractiles templates. Copy the `contractiles/` directory into a new repo to establish a consistent operational, validation, trust, recovery, and intent framework.

== Fill-In Instructions

1. Update the Mustfile to reflect your real invariants (paths, schema versions, ports).
2. Replace Trustfile.hs placeholders with your actual key paths and verification commands.
3. Adjust Dustfile handlers to match your rollback and recovery tooling.
4. Update Intentfile to mirror the roadmap you want the system to evolve toward.

== Contents

* `must/Mustfile` - required invariants and validations.
* `trust/Trustfile.hs` - cryptographic verification steps.
* `dust/Dustfile` - rollback and recovery semantics.
* `lust/Intentfile` - future intent and roadmap direction.
